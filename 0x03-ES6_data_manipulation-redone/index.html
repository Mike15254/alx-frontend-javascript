    <h3>A Report on How To Install A Webserver On My Laptop.</h3>
    <p>This guide will focus on installing Apache, one of the most popular web servers, on a Windows laptop. Apache is a
        free, open-source software that runs on over half of the world's web servers. It's part of the LAMP (Linux,
        Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack, but it can also be installed on Windows and other operating systems.

    <h4>Step 1: Download Apache for Windows</h4>
    Visit the Official Apache Website: Navigate to the Apache HTTP Server Project website at
    <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">apache.org</a>. <br>
    Find a Windows Binary: Apache itself does not provide binary releases for Windows, but you can use third-party
    distributions like ApacheHaus, Apache Lounge, or Bitnami WAMP Stack. For this guide, we'll use Apache Lounge
    because of its popularity and ease of use. <br>
    Download: Go to <a href="https://www.apachelounge.com/download/ ">download apache</a> and download the latest version of the Apache binaries
    for Windows. Make sure to choose the version that matches your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
    <h4>Step 2: Install Apache </h4>
    Extract the Downloaded File: Once the download is complete, extract the ZIP file to your desired location. A
    common practice is to extract it to the root of your C drive, resulting in C:\Apache24 or a similar folder,
    depending on the version. <br>
    Open the Command Prompt as Administrator: You will need administrative privileges to install and run the web
    server. <br>
    Install Apache as a Windows Service: Navigate to the bin directory within your Apache installation folder in the
    command prompt (cd C:\Apache24\bin) and run the command httpd.exe -k install to install Apache as a service.
    <h4>Step 3: Configure Apache</h4>
    Edit the Configuration File: Navigate to the conf folder in your Apache installation directory
    (C:\Apache24\conf) and open the httpd.conf file in a text editor. <br>
    Listen on Port 80: Ensure that the line Listen 80 is present and uncommented to have Apache listen on the
    default HTTP port. <br>
    Server Name: Add a line ServerName localhost:80 to define your server name and port. This is necessary to
    prevent Apache from starting with warnings. <br>
    Save the Configuration File: After making the necessary changes, save and close the httpd.conf file.
    <h4>Step 4: Start Apache</h4>
    Start the Apache Service: Go back to the Command Prompt and start the Apache service by running httpd.exe -k
    start. <br>
    Verify the Installation: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/. If Apache is running, you should
    see the Apache HTTP Server test page.</p>
